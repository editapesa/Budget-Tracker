## Description
Functionality was added to an existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. A user is able to enter deposits and expenses, with or without a data/internet connection. When brought back online, the offline entries will be added to the transaction history. This way a user can track their deposits and withdrawals at any time, in order to maintain an accurate account balance.
